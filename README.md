# Dedicated hours counter
A console application that counts dedicated hour entries in the specified folder

## What is a dedicated hour?
In 2020 I introduced a concept named "Dedicated hours" into my life.

I came up with Dedicated hours because I wanted to know the answer for the question: `How much time did I spend to learn/complete/improve X`? Where X can be any activity you want to track.

Let me show you an example from my life. I wanted to learn Python language, so I created an activity called **Learning Python**. I found a Python course on Udemy.com and decided that finishing that course will be my goal for the activity. Today the course is completed and it took me 25 dedicated hours.<br>
But what exactly does mean 25 dedicated hours? It means that I set in front of my computer for 25 hours collectively - without **any** breaks like bathroom breaks, making a beverage or reading a mail. I use a timer that is set to 1 hour (it can be any amount of time) and if I need a break I will pause it. Every time the timer expires I create an entry called `Learning Python` in a text file that is named today's date, thus creating a database that contains all my completed activity for the day.

## The purpose of this program
This program was designed to walk through all the files filled with Dedicated hours entries and count the total amount of hours and minutes dedicated for the specified activity.

## Miscellaneous
- Entries like `Learning Python` mean that I dedicated 1 hour. Entries like `45' Learning Python` mean that I dedicated 45 minutes. If I dedicate more than one hour in a row, I simply duplicate the line with that activity.
- I use Notepad++ for creating Dedicated hour entries because I find it very efficient for adding new entries.
- Every file contains also a separator `-------` below which I store recent activities so that I can easily move them above once I finished that activity.
- Here are two examples of dedicated hour files from my life: [15.01.2022.txt](https://savenko.pl/My%20drive/15.01.2022.txt), [02.07.2023.txt](https://savenko.pl/My%20drive/02.07.2023.txt)
